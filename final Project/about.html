   		<p>
   		I graduate May 2016 from Skidmore College with a degree in Management and Business with a focus in Marketing and Advertising, and a minor in Studio Arts with an emphasis in Communication Design.
   		</p>
   		<p>
		I was fortunate to spend a half a year in Paris where I took courses in marketing, branding, and photography. Drawing inspiration from this iconic and culturally diverse city to create new branding and marketing concepts for my projects, became the cornerstone of my career path. My academics and business experience have given me the tools of interpersonal and business communication skills along with strong organization and attention to detail.
